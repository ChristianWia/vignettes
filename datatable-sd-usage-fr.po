"In the broadest sense, `.SD` is just shorthand for capturing a variable "
"that comes up frequently in the context of data analysis. It can be "
"understood to stand for *S*ubset, *S*elfsame, or *S*elf-reference of the "
"*D*ata. That is, `.SD` is in its most basic guise a *reflexive reference* "
"to the `data.table` itself -- as we'll see in examples below, this is "
"particularly helpful for chaining together \"queries\" (extractions/subsets/"
"etc using `[`). In particular, this also means that `.SD` is *itself a "

"The simpler usage of `.SD` is for column subsetting (i.e., when `.SDcols` "

"usage, grouping scenarios (i.e., when `by = ` or `keyby = ` is specified), "
"is slightly different, conceptually (though at core it's the same, since, "
